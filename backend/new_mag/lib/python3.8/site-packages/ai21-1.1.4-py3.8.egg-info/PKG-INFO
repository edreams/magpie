Description: # AI21 Studio Client
        Python client for the AI21 Studio API
        
        ## API Keys
        API key can be set globally, using ai21.api_key, or alternatively - be passed to any function call
        as a named argument. For example - ai21.Dataset.get(api_key=api_key)
        
        ## Installation:
        `pip install -U ai21`
        
        ## Client customization
        The ai21 namespace has parameters that one can set globally, and they will
        be used by all the following client calls.
        One can also pass each of these parameters as a named argument.
        If a parameter is overridden globally, and also passed as a named argument -
        the passed named argument will be used with the following client calls.
        The supported parameters are described below:
        ```text
        * api_key (str) - the key to be used for the Authorization header
        * organization (str) - this information is sent as part of the user-agent
        * application (str) - this information is sent as part of the user-agent
        * api_version (str) - the api version. (i.e. v1 / v2). Default=v1
        * api_host (str) - the api host. Default=https://api.ai21.com
        * timeout_sec (int) - the number of seconds the client must wait before cutting the connection. Default=30
        * num_retries (int) - the number of attempts to retry a failure response. Default=0 (no retries)
        * log_level (str) - debug / info / error (Default=error)
        ```
        ### Retry on Failure
        By default, there is no retry on failures. If setting the num_retries parameter
        to an integer greater than 0, then all the following client calls will retry up to the specified
        number of times on the following http error codes: 429, 500, 503.

        ## Usage
        
        ### Studio API
        In the following example, an AI21 API client is used with an API key and a timeout parameter set globally.
        This example uses a simple completion call with only prompt and maxTokens arguments supplied
        (all other completion settings are set to their defaults):
        ```python
        import ai21
        
        ai21.api_key = 'my_api_key'
        ai21.timeout_sec = 20
        response = ai21.Completion.execute(
            model="j2-ultra",
            prompt="Write a news release in the voice of a global banking conglomerate announcing an unprecedented building campaign to expand and rebuild their corporate headquarters in Alpha Centauri.",
            maxTokens=200,
        )
        print(response)
        ```
        
        ### AWS Client
        This python SDK can also be used to invoke Jurassic models as a SageMaker (SM) endpoint or as an AWS Bedrock API.
        To activate this option, make sure to install with the extra AWS dependencies:
        
        `pip install -U "ai21[AWS]"`
        
        #### Sagemaker endpoint request
        You can then generate a completion by running:
        ```python
        import ai21
        
        response = ai21.Completion.execute(
            destination=ai21.SageMakerDestination("<your_endpoint_name>"),
            prompt="Write a news release in the voice of a global banking conglomerate announcing an unprecedented building campaign to expand and rebuild their corporate headquarters in Alpha Centauri.",
            maxTokens=200,
        )
        
        print(response)
        ```
        
        #### Bedrock API request
        You can use one of the models offered in the following list as model_id:
        - ai21.j2-grande-instruct
        - ai21.j2-jumbo-instruct
        
        ```python
        import ai21
        
        # The bedrock API is available only to us-east-1 scoped clients right now
        ai21.aws_region = 'us-east-1'
        
        response = ai21.Completion.execute(
            destination=ai21.BedrockDestination(model_id=ai21.BedrockModelID.J2_JUMBO_INSTRUCT),
            prompt="Write a news release in the voice of a global banking conglomerate announcing an unprecedented building campaign to expand and rebuild their corporate headquarters in Alpha Centauri.",
            maxTokens=200,
        )
        
        print(response)
        ```
